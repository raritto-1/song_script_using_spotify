## Description
I created this project following the steps provided by Spotify. If anyone wants to modify it or use their own token, they can add the client_id and client_secret in the env folder.
The frontend was entirely generated by ChatGPT, so it's not a big deal.
The project works with the Flask API, so there is no need to create a database model.
